                    <p>I am a Systems Information student at UNISANTA. Currently in my seventh semester, 
                        my main interests are in front-end and fullstack development. Additionally, I am 
                        immersing myself in the professional world through an internship at Bertioga City Hall, 
                        where I am involved in constant learning.
